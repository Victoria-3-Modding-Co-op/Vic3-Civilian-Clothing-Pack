This repository uses the [git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) model for branch management.

* Name feature branches as `feature/name` (e.g. `feature/cool_new_hats`)

* Do not push to `master`

* Do not push to `develop` unless you're just merging in a feature branch or making a very minor tweak/hotfix - if in doubt, work on a feature branch & submit a pull/merge request instead

Unfamiliar with git? Try checking out the [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) - read the first three chapters to get started & learn the basics of git.
